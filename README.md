# StartAllBack Trial Reset

A Python script that resets the trial period for StartAllBack software on Windows.

## Description

This script modifies Windows registry entries to reset the trial period for StartAllBack, a Windows customization tool. It works by updating the activation timestamp in the Windows Registry under the CLSID keys.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Python 3.x
- StartAllBack must be installed
- Administrator privileges (for registry access)

## Standard Library Dependencies
- `winreg` - For Windows registry operations
- `time` - For timestamp generation
- `msvcrt` - For handling keyboard input

## Usage

1. Make sure StartAllBack is installed on your system
2. Run the script with administrator privileges:
   ```
   python startallback-activator.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Search for StartAllBack registry entries
   - Reset the trial period if found
   - Display appropriate messages
4. Press any key to exit after the operation is complete

## How it Works

The script:
1. Searches through Windows Registry CLSID entries
2. Locates StartAllBack-specific registry keys
3. Updates the activation timestamp to reset the trial period
4. Provides immediate feedback on the operation's success
